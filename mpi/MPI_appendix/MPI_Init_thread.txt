MPI_Init_thread(3)                    MPI                   MPI_Init_thread(3)



NAME
       MPI_Init_thread -  Initialize the MPI execution environment

SYNOPSIS
       #include "mpi.h"
       int MPI_Init_thread(int *argc, char ***argv, int required, int *provided )

INPUT PARAMETERS
       argc   - Pointer to the number of arguments
       argv   - Pointer to the argument vector
       required
              - Level of desired thread support


OUTPUT PARAMETER
       provided
              - Level of provided thread support


COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
       MPI specifies no command-line arguments but does allow an MPI implemen-
       tation to make use of them.  See MPI_INIT for a description of the com-
       mand line arguments supported by MPI_INIT and MPI_INIT_THREAD .



NOTES
       Note  that  the Fortran binding for this routine does not have the argc
       and argv arguments. ( MPI_INIT_THREAD(required, provided, ierror) )

       Currently, MPICH places the same restrictions on MPI_INIT_THREAD as  on
       MPI_INIT (see the MPI_INIT man page).  When MPICH fully supports MPI-2,
       this restriction will be removed (as requried by the MPI-2 standard).


SIGNALS USED
       The MPI standard requires that all signals  used  be  documented.   The
       MPICH  implementation  itself uses no signals, but some of the software
       that MPICH relies on may use some signals.  The list below  is  partial
       and  should  be  independantly checked if you (and any package that you
       use) depend on particular signals.


IBM POE/MPL FOR SP2
       SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV,  SIGPIPE,  SIGALRM,  SIGTERM,
       SIGIO


-MPEDBG SWITCH
       SIGQUIT, SIGILL, SIGFPE, SIGBUS, SIGSEGV, SIGSYS


MEIKO CS2
       SIGUSR2


CH_P4 DEVICE
       SIGUSR1

       The ch_p4 device also catches SIGINT, SIGFPE, SIGBUS, and SIGSEGV; this
       helps the p4 device (and MPICH) more gracefully abort a failed program.


INTEL PARAGON (CH_NX AND NX DEVICE)
       SIGUSR2


SHARED MEMORY (CH_SHMEM DEVICE)
       SIGCHLD

       Note  that  if  you are using software that needs the same signals, you
       may find that there is no way to use that software with the MPI  imple-
       mentation.   The  signals  that cause the most trouble for applications
       include SIGIO , SIGALRM , and SIGPIPE .  For example, using  SIGIO  and
       SIGPIPE may prevent X11 routines from working.


ERRORS
       All  MPI  routines  (except  MPI_Wtime  and MPI_Wtick ) return an error
       value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines  in
       the last argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
       handler is called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI  job.
       The  error  handler may be changed with MPI_Errhandler_set ; the prede-
       fined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values
       to  be  returned.  Note that MPI does not guarentee that an MPI program
       can continue past an error.

       MPI_SUCCESS
              - No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
       MPI_ERR_OTHER
              - This error class is associated with an error code  that  indi-
              cates  that  an attempt was made to call MPI_INIT a second time.
              MPI_INIT may only be called once in a program.
