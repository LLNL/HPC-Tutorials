This group of routines is used for interrogating and setting the MPI execution environment, and covers an assortment of purposes, such as initializing and terminating the MPI environment, querying a rank's identity, querying the MPI library's version, etc. Most of the commonly used ones are described below.

[**MPI_Init**](MPI_INIT.txt)

Initializes the MPI execution environment. This function must be called in every MPI program, must be called before any other MPI functions and must be called only once in an MPI program. For C programs, MPI_Init may be used to pass the command line arguments to all processes, although this is not required by the standard and is implementation dependent.

```
MPI_Init (&argc,&argv)
MPI_INIT (ierr)
```

[**MPI_Comm_size**](MPI_COMM_SIZE.txt)

Returns the total number of MPI processes in the specified communicator, such as MPI_COMM_WORLD. If the communicator is MPI_COMM_WORLD, then it represents the number of MPI tasks available to your application.

```
MPI_Comm_size (comm,&size)
MPI_COMM_SIZE (comm,size,ierr)
```

[**MPI_Comm_rank**](MPI_COMM_RANK.txt)

Returns the rank of the calling MPI process within the specified communicator. Initially, each process will be assigned a unique integer rank between 0 and number of tasks - 1 within the communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD. This rank is often referred to as a task ID. If a process becomes associated with other communicators, it will have a unique rank within each of these as well.

```
MPI_Comm_rank (comm,&rank)
MPI_COMM_RANK (comm,rank,ierr)
```

[**MPI_Abort**](MPI_ABORT.txt)

Terminates all MPI processes associated with the communicator. In most MPI implementations it terminates ALL processes regardless of the communicator specified.

```
MPI_Abort (comm,errorcode)
MPI_ABORT (comm,errorcode,ierr)
```

[**MPI_Get_processor_name**](MPI_GET_PROCESSOR_NAME.txt)

Returns the processor name. Also returns the length of the name. The buffer for "name" must be at least MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME characters in size. What is returned into "name" is implementation dependent - may not be the same as the output of the "hostname" or "host" shell commands.

```
MPI_Get_processor_name (&name,&resultlength)
MPI_GET_PROCESSOR_NAME (name,resultlength,ierr)
```

[**MPI_Get_version**](MPI_GET_VERSION.txt)

Returns the version and subversion of the MPI standard that's implemented by the library.

```
MPI_Get_version (&version,&subversion)
MPI_GET_VERSION (version,subversion,ierr)
```

[**MPI_Initialized**](MPI_INITIALIZED.txt)

Indicates whether MPI_Init has been called - returns flag as either logical true (1) or false(0). MPI requires that MPI_Init be called once and only once by each process. This may pose a problem for modules that want to use MPI and are prepared to call MPI_Init if necessary. MPI_Initialized solves this problem.

```
MPI_Initialized (&flag)
MPI_INITIALIZED (flag,ierr)
```

[**MPI_Wtime**](MPI_WTIME.txt)

Returns an elapsed wall clock time in seconds (double precision) on the calling processor.

```
MPI_Wtime ()
MPI_WTIME ()
```

[**MPI_Wtick**](MPI_WTICK.txt)

Returns the resolution in seconds (double precision) of MPI_Wtime.

```
MPI_Wtick ()
MPI_WTICK ()
```

[**MPI_Finalize**](MPI_FINALIZE.txt)

Terminates the MPI execution environment. This function should be the last MPI routine called in every MPI program - no other MPI routines may be called after it.

```
MPI_Finalize ()
MPI_FINALIZE (ierr)
```

### Examples

#### C Language - Environment Management Routines

```c
// required MPI include file
#include "mpi.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
int  numtasks, rank, len, rc;
char hostname[MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME];

// initialize MPI
MPI_Init(&argc,&argv);

// get number of tasks
MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD,&numtasks);

// get my rank
MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD,&rank);

// this one is obvious
MPI_Get_processor_name(hostname, &len);
printf ("Number of tasks= %d My rank= %d Running on %s\n", numtasks,rank,hostname);


    // do some work with message passing


// done with MPI
MPI_Finalize();
}
```

#### Fortran - Environment Management Routines

```fortran
program simple

! required MPI include file
include 'mpif.h'

integer numtasks, rank, len, ierr
character(MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME) hostname

! initialize MPI
call MPI_INIT(ierr)

! get number of tasks
call MPI_COMM_SIZE(MPI_COMM_WORLD, numtasks, ierr)

! get my rank
call MPI_COMM_RANK(MPI_COMM_WORLD, rank, ierr)

! this one is obvious
call MPI_GET_PROCESSOR_NAME(hostname, len, ierr)
print *, 'Number of tasks=',numtasks,' My rank=',rank,' Running on=',hostname


    ! do some work with message passing


! done with MPI
call MPI_FINALIZE(ierr)

end
```
