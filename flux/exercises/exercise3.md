1. Ensure that you have a Flux instance running in an allocation and determine the number of cores available to you in that allocation.
2. Write a batch script that will run the `mpi_hellosleep` application from [Exercise 2.2](/flux/exercises/exercise2) with four tasks. Ensure that the script logs when it starts and ends and that it is self documenting.

### Notes / Solutions
1. See [Exercise 1](/flux/exercises/exercise1).
2. See 'Making your job script submission self documenting' in [Section 3](/flux/section3).
